# FA19 423 Final Project

* Using the IAM off-line Handwritten Text Recognition dataset for implementing a deep learning project.
* Neural Network created by TensorFlow (TF) and trained on the IAM dataset
* I used the words images for testing and used the sentences for training
* 3/4 of the words from the validation-set are correctly recognized and the character error rate is around 10%
